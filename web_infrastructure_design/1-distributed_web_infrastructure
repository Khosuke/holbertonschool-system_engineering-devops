# Infrastructure Components
### Load Balancer (HAProxy)

**Why added:** It distributes incoming traffic between the two servers, preventing overload on a single machine.

**Distribution Algorithm:** Round-robin – requests are sent alternately to each server, ensuring even load distribution.

**Active-Active Setup:** Both servers handle requests simultaneously.

**Active-Active:** Improves performance and redundancy (used here).

**Active-Passive:** One server handles traffic; the other is on standby for failover.

### Two Servers (identical setup)
Each server contains:

**NGINX (Web Server):** Handles incoming HTTP/S requests and serves static content.

**Application Server:** Executes the backend logic (e.g., PHP, Python).

**Application Files:** The website’s codebase, including dynamic content processing logic.

**Why added:**
Improves fault tolerance (one can fail and the site stays up).
Increases capacity to serve more users.

### Database Cluster (Primary + Replica)

**Primary (Master):** Handles all writes and updates.

**Replica (Slave):** Syncs from the Primary and handles read-only queries.

**Why added:**
Reduces read load on the Primary.
Provides redundancy for failover and data safety.

# Infrastructure Issues
### Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

The Load Balancer itself is a SPOF. If it fails, users can’t access the servers.

**Solution:** Use a second Load Balancer in Active-Passive or Active-Active mode.

### Security Issues

**No firewall:** Servers are exposed to unwanted traffic.

**No HTTPS**: Communication is not encrypted, risking data interception.

**Solution:** Use TLS certificates and configure HTTPS.

### No Monitoring

No system to track server health, traffic, or database replication status.

**Solution:** Add tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Nagios for real-time alerts and metrics.
